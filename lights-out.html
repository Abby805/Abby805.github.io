      <p>This project is ongoing. Lights Out DC is a non-profit organization that works to create a more bird-safe city by educating architects and building owners about the dangers of certain types of glass architecture to migratory birds. During migratory season, their volunteers walk daily routes around the city to find, document, and collect birds that have been injured or killed by collisions with buildings. In addition to treating and releasing those birds that can be rehabilitated, the group leverages the data gathered to demonstrate which buildings pose particular dangers to birds, and suggest potential solutions.</p>

      <p>The photos below were taken at their annual tagging event, where a team of volunteers prepares the deceased birds from the past year (kept frozen) to be sent to the Smithsonian, where they will be used for research, education, or traded to other academic institutions.</p>

          <p>Volunteers frequently consult each other while they work, whether to point out something interesting or ask for clarification on some aspect of the labeling. Although the task at hand is sobering, this event is also one of the only occasions when all of the volunteers are together in one place and have the chance to catch up.</p>
